DESCRIPTION
===========

Finds text-regions in RGB images.

It uses the EAST deep-CNN model via OpenCV, which generates a list of rotated bounding-boxes of proposed text regions,
each with a confidence score.

A non-maxima suppression algorithm reduces the proposals to a smaller set by eliminating significantly overlapping proposals.

The EAST model was designed to work with 1280x720 RBB images. The input image is scaled down to be approximately
similar in size.


======
INPUTS
======

input_image:
    A RGB stack


=======
OUTPUTS
=======

objects:
    HDF5 object-masks for all the bounding-boxes that are eventually accepted

mask:
    a binary-mask combining all the object-masks in an image

outline:
    a green outline imposed on the original RGB around each object-mask
