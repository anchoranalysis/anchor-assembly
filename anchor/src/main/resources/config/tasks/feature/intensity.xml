TASK:   feature/intensity
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Extracts basic statistics calculates from all voxel intensities in an image channel.

The statistics are calculated separately for each channel, up to a maximum of 6 channels (if they exist).

The statistics are: sum, mean, standard-deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.


======
INPUTS
======

An image, any number of channels.


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which adds a group column to the CSV, and creates group-specific feature CSVs.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)
 
See: http://www.anchoranalysis.org/user_guide_command_line.html#grouping


=======
OUTPUTS
=======

features:
    a CSV file with each image's name and intensity features
