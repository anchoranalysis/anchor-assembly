TASK:   montage/preserveOrder
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Combines (scaled) versions of each image alongside each other into a single image - strictly preserving order of the images, but otherwise filling available space.

A different number of images may exist in each row, but aspect-ratio is always preserved for each image.

By default, each image will be scaled to approximately 600x480 (but usually not exactly this size, to preserve aspect ratio, and fill available space).

======
INPUTS
======

images

The -ps parameter can be used to specify a scale-factor to resize each image approximately to, or the width of the final combined image.

e.g. -ps 0.4  or -ps 4000x

See https://www.anchoranalysis.org/user_guide_command_line.html 

Note that other forms of the -ps option are unsupported.
