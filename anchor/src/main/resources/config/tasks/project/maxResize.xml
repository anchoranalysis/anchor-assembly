AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a maximum-intensity-projection of all input images AFTER
resizing each-image to fixed dimensionality.

This is an an image where each pixel is the maximum of the corresponding pixel across all inputs.

This task is like max.xml but can gracefully handle differently-sized imaged as inputs.

======
INPUTS
======

grayscale or RGB images, all must be the same size.

=======
OUTPUTS
=======

an image for each channel (resized to 1024x768), containing the maximum of that channel across all images
