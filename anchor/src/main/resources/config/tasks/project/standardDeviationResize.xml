TASK:   project/standardDeviationResize
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a standard-deviation-intensity projection of all input images AFTER
resizing each-image to fixed dimensionality.

This is an an image where each pixel is the standard-deviation of the corresponding pixel across all inputs.

This task is like standardDeviation.xml but can gracefully handle differently-sized imaged as inputs.

======
INPUTS
======

grayscale or RGB images, all must be the same size.

=======
OUTPUTS
=======

an image for each channel (resized to 1024x768), containing the standard-deviation of that channel across all images


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which aggregations image per group, rather than as a whole.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)
