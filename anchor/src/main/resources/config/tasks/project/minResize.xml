TASK:   project/minResize
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a minimum-intensity-projection of all input images AFTER
resizing each-image to fixed dimensionality.

This is an an image where each pixel is the minimum of the corresponding pixel across all inputs.

This task is like min.xml but can gracefully handle differently-sized imaged as inputs.

======
INPUTS
======

grayscale or RGB images, all must be the same size.

=======
OUTPUTS
=======

an image for each channel (resized to 1024x768), containing the minimum of that channel across all images


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which aggregations image per group, rather than as a whole.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)
