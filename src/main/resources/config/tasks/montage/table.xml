TASK:   montage/table
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Combines (scaled) versions of each image alongside each other into a single image - strictly preserving order of the images, and imposing a strict table pattern.

An identical number of images must in exist in each row of the table (except an incomplete final row).

The images are scaled to fit inside each table cell, while preserving aspect-ratio strictly. Unused space is black.

By default, each image will be scaled to 600x480 and this forms the approximate table cell size, depending on the aspect-ratio of the images in each row and column.

INPUTS
======

images

The -ps parameter can be used to specify a scale-factor to resize each image approximately to

e.g. -ps 0.4

See https://www.anchoranalysis.org/user_guide_command_line.html 

Note that other forms of the -ps option are unsupported.
