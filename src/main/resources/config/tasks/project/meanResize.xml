TASK:   project/meanResize
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a mean-intensity projection of all input images AFTER
resizing each-image to fixed dimensionality.

This is an an image where each pixel is the mean of the corresponding pixel across all inputs.

This task is like mean.xml but can gracefully handle differently-sized imaged as inputs.

======
INPUTS
======

grayscale or RGB images, all must be the same size.


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which aggregations image per group, rather than as a whole.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)

=======
OUTPUTS
=======

an image for each channel (resized to 1024x768), containing the mean of that channel across all images
