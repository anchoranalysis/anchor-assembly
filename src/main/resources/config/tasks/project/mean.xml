TASK:   project/mean
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a mean-intensity projection of all input images.

This is an an image where each pixel is the mean of the corresponding pixel across all inputs.

The input images must all be identically-sized. See meanResize.xml for a similar task that can gracefully handle differently-sized imaged.


======
INPUTS
======

grayscale or RGB images, all must be the same size.


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which aggregations image per group, rather than as a whole.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)

=======
OUTPUTS
=======

an image for each channel, containing the mean of that channel across all images
