TASK:   project/min
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a minimum-intensity-projection of all input images.

This is an an image where each pixel is the minimum of the corresponding pixel across all inputs.

The input images must all be identically-sized. See minResize.xml for a similar task that can gracefully handle differently-sized imaged.


======
INPUTS
======

grayscale or RGB images, all must be the same size.


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which aggregations image per group, rather than as a whole.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)

=======
OUTPUTS
=======

an image for each channel, containing the minimum of that channel across all images
