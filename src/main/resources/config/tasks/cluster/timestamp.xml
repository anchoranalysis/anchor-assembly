TASK:   timestamp
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Copies inputs to the output directory, clustering the files into subdirectories, based upon a timestamp associated with each file.

The timestamp is determined, in this order of priority:

 - A date / time string extracted from the filename, if exists.
 - A "original" or "creation" time extracted from EXIF metadata if available (only with a jpg or jpeg extension).
 - The creation time of the file on the file-system.
 
 The thresholdHours parameter can influence how large/smaller the clusters are. Files whose creation-time differs {@code <=} this parameter are joined into the same cluster.
 
 A larger value encourages a smaller total number of clusters (or larger cluster-size). A smaller values encourages the opposite.

any files

OUTPUTS

files:
   	a bytewise copy of each file in the output directory, according to its original naming relative to a inferred directory root, and a cluster subdirectory.
   	
   	creation-date is preserved during the copy.
