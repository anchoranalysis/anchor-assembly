TASK:   histogram
AUTHOR: Owen Feehan
===================

===========
DESCRIPTION
===========

Extracts histograms of the intensity values of an image.

It works also with 3D images (every voxel).

======
INPUTS
======

images, all must be the same size and with the same number of channels.


Grouping:

The -pg command-line activates grouping, which creates group-specific CSV files in the sum/ directory.

 e.g. -pg 0:1 (to group by first and second directories in the identifier)
 
See: http://www.anchoranalysis.org/user_guide_command_line.html#grouping


=======
OUTPUTS
=======

channels:
	a histogram (in CSV format) for the pixels of each channel separately.

sum:
	a histogram (in CSV format) for the sum of each pixel's intensity across all channels.
