# Integration tests for Anchor's tasks

This directory contains integration-tests that launch Anchor's CLI together with different
task definitions that are bundles with it in anchor-assembly's resources.

The integration-tests do some basic checks to ensure a task executes successfully and produces some expected files.

These tests form an important final-stage check before releasing Anchor that can catch some problems.
